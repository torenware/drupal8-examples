#
# As part of our demo, we implement a simple "file system" that lets us read and write
# files out of the $_SESSION.  This isn't very practical, but it's a simple way to
# demonstrate what you can do with PHP's stream wrappers.
#
# To get a stream wrapper to work to define a stream wrapper class, we need to register
# that with the system.  We can either do this manually by calling up the 'stream_wrapper.manager'
# service, but the better way to do this is to have the system autoload it by tagging the service,
# as we do here.
